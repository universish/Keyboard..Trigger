        Program Name: Keyboard Trigger
        Program Package Name or Application ID: 
    com.universish.libre.keyboardtrigger
        About and my Idea: The dynamic button that activates the keyboard
    is a button that can be placed on the edges of the screen. 
    Pressing the button brings up the keyboard. The application is
    privacy-focused.  There is no tracking or advertising. It does not
    require internet access. It does not interfere with text editing
    and does not break focus. It is a FLOSS Android application.
